# 🛡️ Real-Time Safety Monitoring System

Welcome to the **Real-Time Safety Monitoring System**, a comprehensive web-based application designed to enhance workplace safety through **real-time monitoring** of **PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)** compliance using **AI-powered computer vision**.

This system helps automate and improve safety in high-risk environments such as **construction sites, warehouses, and factories**, detecting if workers are missing critical safety gear (helmet, vest, glasses) via live camera streams and real-time alerts.

## 💡 Why This Project?

Safety is a top priority in industrial environments. Manual monitoring of PPE is inefficient and prone to errors. We wanted to build a system that:

- 📹 Monitors workers via live camera feeds
- 🤖 Uses AI to detect missing PPE instantly
- 🖥️ Visualizes incidents, trends, and reports in a responsive web dashboard
- 🌐 Supports multiple languages and is easy to use

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔐 **User Login**: Secure, role-based login system
- 📺 **Real-Time Camera Feed**: Monitor up to 6 live cameras
- 🚨 **AI-Powered Detection**: YOLOv8 detects helmet, vest, and glasses violations
- 📈 **Summary Dashboard**: Weekly trend charts, safety score, alert heatmaps
- 📅 **Timeline View**: Camera-wise alert history
- 📁 **Report Page**: Alert logs, worker data, manual reporting
- ⚙️ **Settings Page**: Theme toggle (Dark/Light), language switch
- 🌗 **Dark & Light Modes**: User-selectable interface theme
- 🌍 **Multi-Language Support**: English 🇺🇸 and Korean 🇰🇷 with `react-i18next`
- 📤 **CSV Download**: Export alerts for safety audits

---

## 🧠 AI Integration

- 🤖 Model: **YOLOv8n**  
- 🖼️ Dataset:  
  - **Phase 1**: 1,176 images  
  - **Phase 2**: 2,551 images (focused on head detection)

- ⚙️ Inference Process:
  ```plaintext
  [Camera Feed] → [YOLO AI (Subprocess)] → [Annotated Frame + Label] → [FastAPI Backend] → [Frontend UI]
